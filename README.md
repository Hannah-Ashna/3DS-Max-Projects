# 3DS Max Projects
Decided to compile all of my personal mini-projects along with some module exercises into one Github repo. I'm by no means a professional at 3DS Max. I'm just a hobbyist that's really interested in 3D Modelling and using the software to create assets for the tiny game projects I work on.
