# 3DS Max Projects
Decided to compile all of my personal mini-projects along with some module exercises into one Github repo. I'm by no means a professional at 3DS Max. I'm just a hobbyist that's really interested in 3D Modelling and using the software to create assets for the tiny game projects I work on.

#### Some Screenshots:
Here's my attempt at a custom chess set with my **bird**-looking knight ...

Decided to apply some of the techniques we learnt over Term 1 by recreating a sword from one of my favourite TV-shows. The 'demon-blood' sword from Adventure Time definitely required some creative problem solving when it came down to the handle portion and the intricate detail within it ... I ended up deciding to use proboolean to create the gaps within it ...

Creating this grass patch was surprisingly easy, all I needed to add to the base plane was a noise modifier (to get that uneven base) and a hair and fur modifier to get the grass blades. The hair and fur modifier allows for quite a bit of customisation in terms of the frequency of occurrence, scale, thickness, etc.   
I have yet to implement a texture map to this model just yet, hence, the fairly basic colours.
